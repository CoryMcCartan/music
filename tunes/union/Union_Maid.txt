There once was a union maid, she never was afraid
Of goons and ginks and company finks and the deputy sheriffs who made the raid
She went to the union hall when a meeting it was called
And when the Legion boys come 'round she always stood her ground.

!Oh, you can't scare me, I'm sticking to the union,
!I'm sticking to the union, I'm sticking to the union.
!Oh, you can't scare me, I'm sticking to the union,
!I'm sticking to the union 'til the day I die.

This union maid was wise to the tricks of company spies,
She couldn't be fooled by a company stool, she'd always organize the guys.
She always got her way when she struck for better pay.
She'd show her card to the National Guard and this is what she'd say
