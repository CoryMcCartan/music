Come all you good workers,
Good news to you I'll tell
Of how the good old union
Has come in here to dwell.
# Am - Em Am / Em Am E Am

!Which side are you on, folks? Which side are you on?
!Which side are you on, folks? Which side are you on?
# Am - E Am ://

They say in Harlan County
There are no neutrals there.
You'll either be a union man
Or a thug for J. H. Blair.

My daddy was a miner,
And I'm a miner's son,
And Iâ€™ll be with the union 
Until this battle's won.

Oh workers can you stand it?
Oh tell me how you can?
Will you be a lousy scab
Or will you be a man?

Don't scab for the bosses
Don't listen to their lies
Us poor folks haven't got a chance
Unless we organize
