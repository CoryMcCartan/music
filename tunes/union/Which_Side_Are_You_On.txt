Come all you good workers,
Good news to you I'll tell
Of how the good old union
Has come in here to dwell.
Am - Em Am / Em Am E Am

!Which side are you on, folks? Which side are you on?
!Which side are you on, folks? Which side are you on?
# Am - E Am ://

They say in Poweshiek County
There are no neutrals there.
You'll either stand for union rights
Or you fight against what’s fair

My daddy was a miner,
And I'm a miner's son,
And I’ll be with the union 
Until this battle's won.

Oh workers can you stand it?
Oh tell me how you can?
Will you be a lousy scab
Or will you be a man?
