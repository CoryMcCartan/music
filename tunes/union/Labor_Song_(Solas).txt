Come all ye gallant miners, who toil beneath the ground
Where you risk you neck down daily where danger it abounds
But our lives are took for granted, they throw us meager pay 
And our belts are getting longer while our children fade away 
# C--- / F C- F / C--- / F C G C

!Together we must stand, boys, divided we will fall 
!No more we'll go below, boys, let's heed the union's call 
!Throw down your picks and shovels until we've had our say 
!For our lives are worth far more than four lousy bucks a day
# C-- F- / F C-- / " / " /

Where are those corporate miners who motion all the day
To judges in their pockets, they legalized bad pay
They wont ask about your mortage or what your children need
As they dine with city daddies, and bow down to their greed

!Don't rise to provacation, just burn your rustling cards
!We shouldn't need permission to toil and labor hard 
!For filling city pockets, rewarded we should be 
!For a man who works all day and night has earned some dignity.

We'll fight for those who perished in the fire of '17
As the company shrugged its shoulders they went up like gasoline
Courage worn down to the knuckles as they waited there to die 
And beside the doorless bulkheads, the bodies they piled high

!So you think your life they'll value, when finally you fall?
!Having blast and dug for countless days and given it your all 
!For what they'll pay your widow won't even bear the cost 
!To lift you up to Duggan's place to put you in a box

# C Dm G Am / F--- :// C--- 

Now don't believe that wolf, the so-called Council of Defense
Their patriotism's twisted, their loyalties are bent
In the shadow of the eagle, they'll blacklist you and me 
Saying because we love our families we don't love our country 

!So when you cry for justice, let it be no surprise
!When they brand you all as traitors and commies in disguise
!They say you're Gyps and cat's paws of the Kaiser's Germany 
!While our friends, they swallow bullets so our children can be free

So we've got to seal the unions, we've need the close the shop
And fight the company suits and copper collars at the top
But it's on the Wall Street tickers, they'll keep their beady eyes 
And our cry will fall on deaf ears as the working miner dies

!So together we must stand, boys, ...
!Oh, our lives are worth far more than four lousy bucks a day (2x)
