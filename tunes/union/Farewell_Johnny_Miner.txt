Johnny Miner, you were born
Never to see the rising dawn
Now it's time that you were gone
Farewell Johnny Miner!

!And farewell Durham, Yorkshire too
!Nottingham, the same to you
!Scotland, South Wales, say Adieu
!Farewell Johnny Miner

They've promised you the earth sometimes
To get coal from their stinkin' mines
Now the justice for their crimes
Is Farewell, Johnny Miner!

You've battled with the sliding scale
Lungs turned black & faces pale
Now your body's up for sale
Farewell Johnny Miner!

And Farewell John, don't take it hard
Unemployment isn't bad
They'll treat you well in the knackers' yard
Farewell Johnny Miner!
