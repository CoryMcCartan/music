Fish are _jumpin' and the cotton is high
Oh, your _daddy's rich and your _ma is good-lookin'
So _hush, little baby d_on't you cry

One of these mornings you're going to rise up singing
Then you'll spread your wings and you'll take the sky
But 'til that morning there's a'nothing can harm you
With daddy and mammy standing by
