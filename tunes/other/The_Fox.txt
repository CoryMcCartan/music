The Fox went out on a chilly night
He prayed for the moon to give him light
For he'd many a mile to go that night
Before he reached the town-o / town-o, town-o
He'd many a mile to go that night 
Before he reached the town-o
# D- / - A / D G / DA D / A D / G D / A D

He ran till he came to the farmer's pen
The ducks and the geese were kept therein
He said "a couple of you are gonna grease my chin,
Before I leave this town-o..."

He grabbed the great goose by the neck
And he threw a duck across his back
And he didn't mind the quack quack
And the legs all dangling down-o...

Then old mother Flipper-flapper jumped out of bed
Out of the window she popped her head,
Crying "John, John, the great goose is gone
And the fox is on the town-o..."

He ran till he came to his nice warm den
And there were the little ones, eight, nine, ten
Sayin' Daddy, Daddy, better go back again
For it must be a mighty fine town-o...

The fox and his wife, without any strife
Cut up the goose with a fork and a knife
They never had such a supper in their life
And the little ones chewed on the bones-o..
