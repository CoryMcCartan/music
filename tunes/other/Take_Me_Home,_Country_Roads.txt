Almost heaven, West Virginia
Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River
Life is old there, older than the trees
Younger than the mountains, growing like a breeze

!Country roads, take me home
!To the place I belong
!West Virginia, mountain mama
!Take me home, country roads

All my memories gather 'round her
Miner's lady, stranger to blue water
Dark and dusty, painted on the sky
Misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye

^I hear her voice, in the morning hour she calls me
^The radio reminds me of my home far away
^Driving down the road, I get a feeling
^That I should have been home yesterday, yesterday
