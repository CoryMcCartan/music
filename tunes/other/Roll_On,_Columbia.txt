Green Douglas firs where the waters cut through
Down her wild mountains and canyons she flew
Canadian Northwest to the ocean so blue
!Roll on, Columbia, roll on!
# G D / - G / G C / D G

!Roll on, Columbia, roll on (2x)
!Your power is turning our darkness to dawn,
!So roll on, Columbia, roll on

Other great rivers add power to you,
Yakima, Snake and the Klickitat, too,
Sandy Willamette and Hood River, too / Roll on...

Tom Jefferson's vision would not let him rest
An empire he saw in the Pacific Northwest
Sent Lewis and Clark and they did the rest / Roll...

It's there on your bank that we fought many a fight
Sheridan's boys in the blockhouse that night
They saw us in death but never in flight / Roll...

At Bonneville now there are ships in the locks
The waters have risen and cleared all the rocks
Shiploads of plenty will steam past the docks / Roll...

And on up the river is Grand Coulee Dam
The mightiest thing ever built by a man
To run these great factories and water the land / It's roll...

These might men labored by day and by night
Matching their strength 'gainst the river's wild flight
Through rapids and falls they won the hard fight / Roll...
