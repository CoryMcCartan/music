She packed my bags last night pre-flight
Zero hour nine AM
And I'm gonna be high as a kite by then

I miss the earth so much I miss my wife
It's lonely out in space
On such a timeless flight

!(2x)
!And I think it's gonna be a long long _time
!'Till touch down brings me round again to _find
!I'm not the man they think I am at _home
!Oh, no, no, no, I'm a rocket man
!Rocket man burning out his fuse up here alone

Mars ain't the kind of place to raise your kids
In fact it's cold as hell
And there's no one there to raise them if you did
And all this science I don't understand
It's just my job five days a week
A rocket man, a rocket man

And I think it's gonna be a long long time (8x)
