Come drive me _down to the central station
I hate to _leave my River Tyne
For some damn _town that's god-forsaken
Fare thee _well, Northumberland
Although I'll _go where the lady takes me
She'll never _tell what's in her hand
I do not _know what fate awaits me
Fare thee _well, Northumberland

My heart beats for my streets and alleys
Longs to dwell in the borderlands
The northeast shore and the river valleys
Fare thee well Northumberland
I may not stay, I'm bound for leaving
I'm bound to ramble and to roam
I only say my heart is grieving
I would not gamble on my coming home

!Roll on, geordie boy, roll (4x)
# Am--- /  /  /  /

So drive me down to the central station
I hate to leave my River Tyne
For some damn town that's god-forsaken
Goodbye old friend of mine
Although I'll go where the lady takes me
She'll never tell what's in her hand
I do not know what fate awaits me
Fare thee well, Northumberland
