Imagine there's no heaven, it's easy if you try
No hell below us, Above us only sky
Imagine all the people living for today
# G - C - G - C - /  / C ,-- D---

Imagine there's no countries, it isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for, and no religion too
Imagine all the people living life in peace, ooh

!You may say I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one
!I hope someday you'll join us and the whole world will live as one
# C D G B7 (2x) / C D G B7 C D G-

Imagine no possessions, I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger, a brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people sharing all the world, ooh
