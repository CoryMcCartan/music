Sleep in a bed roll of canvas
No-see-ums feed on your ears
Wind blows the dust just like buckshot
And I ain't never seen it rain much out here
# Am G F E / Am G E- / 1st / F G E- 

Smell your own sweat in the evenin'
Wash up at the galvanized tank
Nearst town forty miles, the cook here he don't smile
And all these young horses are rank
# Am G F E / F G E- / F G C Am / F E Am-

!But come a ty yi yipee I O, on the back of my caballo
!I whoppy tie one on when I can
!My spurs they don't ring much, I never did sing much
!But I'm sure enough, a Buckaroo Man
# Dm G C Am / F G E- / 1st / F E Am-

Cold fingers stiff in the mornin'
By noon it's a hundred and three
Five year old slicks in the canyon
And n_ever a hint of a breeze

Jug-headed hollow-back ponies
Provide all with hours of grief
There's snakes in the shade, Choya on the grade
And a h_alf a ton of grit between my teeth

![Chorus 3x]
