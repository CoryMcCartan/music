It's a lesson too late for the learning
Made of sand, made of sand
In the wink of an eye my soul is turnin'
In your hand, in your hand

!Are you going away with no word of farewell?
!Will there be not a trace left behind?
!Well, I could've loved you better, didn't mean to be unkind
!You know that was the last thing on my mind

As we walk, all my thoughts are a-tumblin' / Round & round...
Underneath our feet the subway's rumblin' / Underground...

You've got reason a plenty for goin' / This I know...
For the weeds have been steadily growin' / Please don't go...

As I lie in my bed in the mornin' / Without you...
Every song in my breast lies a bornin' / Without you...
