Once a jolly swagman camped by a billabong 
Under the shade of a coolibah tree  
He sang as he watched and waited 'til his billy boiled 
"You'll come a-Waltzing Matilda, with me!"
# C G Am F / C- G- / C G Am F / C- G C

!Waltzing Matilda, Waltzing Matilda 
!You'll come a-Waltzing Matilda, with me!
He sang as he watched and waited 'til his billy boiled
!You'll come a-Waltzing Matilda, with me

Down came a jumbuck to drink at the billabong  
Up jumped the swagman and grabbed him with glee
He sang as he shoved that jumbuck in his tucker bag
You'll come a-Waltzing Matilda, with me

Up rode the squatter, mounted on his thoroughbred  
Up rode the troopers, one, two, three  
"Where's that jolly jumbuck you've got in your tucker bag?"
You'll come a-Waltzing Matilda, with me  

Up jumped the swagman and sprang into the billabong  
"You'll never catch me alive!" said he  
And his ghost may be heard as you pass by that billabong
You'll come a-Waltzing Matilda, with me
