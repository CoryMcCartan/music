!Heel yo h_o, boys, let her go, boys
!Swing her h_ead round and all together
!Heel yo h_o, boys, let her go, boys
!Sailing h_omeward to Mingulay

What care we how white the Minch is
What care we for wind or weather
Swing her head round, every inch is
Sailing homeward to Mingulay

Wives are waiting by the quayside
They've been waiting since break of day
Swing her head round, and we'll anchor
As the sun sets on Mingulay

When the wind is wild with shouting
And the waves mount ever higher
Anxious eyes turn ever seaward
To see us home, boys, to Mingulay
# Bb / Eb------- / Bb--- Ab-- 
# Bb / Eb--- (Cm)--- / Bb--Ab (Eb)--

Ships return now, heavy laden
Mothers holdin' bairns a-cryin'
They'll return, yet, when the sun sets
Sailing homeward to Mingulay.
