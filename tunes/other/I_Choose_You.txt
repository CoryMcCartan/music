Let the bough break, let it come down crashing
Let the sun fade out to a dark sky
I can't say I'd even notice it was absent
Cause I could live by the light in your eyes
# G G~F# Em- / Cadd9 G D- ://

I'll unfold before you what I've strung together
The very first words of a lifelong love letter
# Em- Cadd9- / A Cadd9 Cm-

!Tell the world that we finally got it all right
!I choose you
!I will become yours and you will become mine
!I choose you
!I choose you
# G G~F# Em- / Cadd9 G D- :// Cadd9 G D -

There was a time when I would have believed them
If they told me you could not come true
Just love's illusion
But then you found me and everything changed
And I believe in something again

My whole heart
Will be yours forever
This is a beautiful start
To a lifelong love letter

^We are not perfect, we'll learn from our mistakes
^And as _long as it takes I will prove my love to you
^I am not scared of the elements, I am under-prepared 
^But I am willing, and even better 
^ I get to be the other half of you
# Em- Cadd9- / G- Dsus2~F# /
# Em- Cadd9- / G-  D- / n.c.
