Little darling
It's been a long cold lonely winter
Little darling
It feels like years since it's been here

Little darling
The smiles returning to their faces
Little darling
It seems like years since it's been here

Little darling
I feel that ice is slowly melting
Little darling
It seems like years since it's been clear
