Slow down, you crazy child
You're so ambitious for a juvenile
But then if you're so smart, 
Then tell me _why are you still so afraid?
# Gm- Bb- / F- Ab- / 
# Eb- / Bb- C- D9sus D 

Where's the fire, what's the hurry about?
You'd better cool it off before you burn it out
You've got so much to do and only 
So many hours in a day

!But you know that when the truth is told
!That you can _get what you want or you can just get old
!You're gonna _kick off before you even get halfway through
!When will you _realize, Vienna waits for you

Slow down, you're doing fine
You can't be everything you want to be before your time
Although it's so romantic on the
Borderline tonight, tonight

Too bad but it's the life you lead
You're so ahead of yourself that you forgot what you need
Though you can see when you're wrong, you know 
You _can't always see when you're right, you're right

!You've got your passion, you've got your pride
!But don't you know that only fools are satisfied?
!Dream on, but don't imagine they'll all come true
!When will you realize, Vienna waits for you?

Slow down, you crazy child
And take the phone off the hook and disappear for awhile
It's all right, you can afford to lose a day or two
When will you realize, Vienna waits for you?

!And you know that when the truth is told...
!Why don't you realize...

When will you _realize, Vienna waits for you?
