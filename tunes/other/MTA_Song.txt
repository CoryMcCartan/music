Well, let me tell you of the story of a man named Charlie
On a tragic and fateful day
He put ten cents in his pocket, kissed his wife and family
Went to ride on the M.T.A.
# G C / G D / G C / GD G

!Well did he ever return? no he never returned
!And his fate is still unlearned (what a pity)
!He may ride forever 'neath the streets of Boston
!He's the man who never returned

Charlie handed in his dime at the Kendall Square station
And he changed for Jamaica Plain
When he got there, the conductor told him "one more nickel"
Charlie couldn't get off of that train.

Now all night long Charlie rides through the station
Crying "what will become of me?"
"How can I afford to see my sister in Chelsea?"
"Or my cousin in Roxbury?"

Charlie's wife goes down to the Scollay Square station
Every day at quarter past two
And through the open window she hands Charlie a sandwich
As the train comes rumblin' through.

Now you citizens of Boston don't you think it's a scandal
How the people have to pay and pay
Fight the fare increase, vote for Walter O'Brian!
And get Charlie off the M.T.A.!
