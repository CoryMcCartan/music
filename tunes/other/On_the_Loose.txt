Have you _ever seen the s_unrise turn the _sky completely r_ed?
Have you ever slept beneath the moon and stars with a pine bough for your head?
Have you sat and talked with friends, though a word was never said?
Then you're like me and you've been on the loose
# G, Em, C D /  / C D G, Em / C D G-

!On the loose to climb a mountain, on the loose where I am free
!On the loose to live my life the way, the way I think my life should be
!For I've only got a moment, and a whole world yet to see
!I'll be searching for tomorrow, on the loose

There's a trail that I'll be hiking just to see where it might go
Many places yet to visit, many people yet to know
And in following my dreams, I will live and I will grow
On a trail that's out there waiting, on the loose

So in search of love and laughter, I'll be travelling through this land
Never sure of where I'm going, for I haven't any plans.
But in time when you are ready, come and join me, take my hand
And together we'll find life, out on the loose
