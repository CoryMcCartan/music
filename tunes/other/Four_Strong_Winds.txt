!Four strong winds that blow lonely, seven seas that run high
!All those things that don't change, come what may
!For our good times are all gone, and I'm bound for moving on
!I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way.

Guess I'll go out to Alberta, weather's good there in the fall
I got some friends that I could go to working for
Still I wish you'd change your mind if I asked you one more time
But we've been through this a hundred times or more

If I get there before the snow flies, and if things are looking good
You could meet me if I sent you down the fare
But by then it would be winter, not too much for you to do
And those winds sure can blow cold way out there
