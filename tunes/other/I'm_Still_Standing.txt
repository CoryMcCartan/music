[Intro]
# Am- Dm~A- E~A-- F~AG~A /  /

You could never know _what it's like
Your b_lood, like winter, freezes j_ust like ice
And there's a c_old, lonely light that sh_ines from you
You'll wind up like the wreck you hide behind that mask you use
And did you think this fool could never win?
Well look at me, I'm a-comin' back again
I got a taste of love in a simple way
And if you need to know while I'm still standin'
You just fade away
# A- D~A- / E~A- A- / 
# Bm7~A- D~A E / F#m- D- ABm~A A-- ://

!Don't you know _I'm still standin' better than I ever did?
!Lookin' like a _true survivor, feelin' like a little kid
!And _I'm still standin' after all this time
!Pickin' up the _pieces of my life without you on my mind
!I'm still _standin' (yeah, yeah, yeah)
!I'm still _standin' (yeah, yeah, yeah)

# Am- Dm7- E7--- / Am- Dm7- E7-- F~EG~E

Once, I never coulda hoped to win
You're startin' down the road, leavin' me again
The threats you made were meant to cut me down
And if our love was just a circus, you'd be a clown by now

[Chorus]

[Instrumental over verse]

[Chorus]

!I'm still standin' (yeah, yeah, yeah)
!I'm still standin' (yeah, yeah, yeah)
[Repeat until end]
