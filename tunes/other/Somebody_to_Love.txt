Ooh, each morning I get up I die a little
Can barely stand on my feet
Take a look in the mirror and cry
Lord, what you're doin' to me 
I have spent all my years in believin' you
But I just can't get no relief, Lord

I work hard (He works hard) every day of my life
I work 'til I ache my bones
At the end (At the end of the day) I take home
My hard-earned pay all on my own
I get down on my knees and I start to pray 
'Til the tears run down from my eyes, Lord

^(He works hard) everyday (Everyday)
^I try and I try and I try
^But everybody wants to put me down
^They say I'm goin' crazy
^They say I got a lot of water in my brain
^I got no common sense
^(He's got) I got nobody left to believe
^No, no, no, no

[Guitar solo over verse]

Got no feel, I got no rhythm
I just keep losin' my beat 
I'm okay, I'm alright 
I ain't gonna face no defeat
I just gotta get out of this prison cell
Someday I'm gonna be free, Lord

Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Can anybody find me
Somebody to love?
