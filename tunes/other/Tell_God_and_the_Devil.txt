Seven years a miner, I'll mine for seven more
No better man on earth now to move the moutain floor
So load us in the chippy the trucks down every day
No braver man on earth boys no matter what they say
# Am--- / -- G- ://

!So tell God and the Devil they can try
!But today's not gonna be the day we die
# G F Am- / F E Am- 

Don't want to see those helmet man to come to carry you
The ground is so cold and hard above they won't even bury you
So tap tap tap her lightly, as lightly as she goes
You better take some cover now and hide before she blows

!Get those bricks and shovels off your backs
!Get the rocks into the box and down the tracks

There's muckers and there's skinners and nippers on the drill
They work all day and night, boys, as only miners will
Will chase rebellious copper, the walls you pick and hack
Don't worry if your digging scared, us miners get you back
# CG~B Am CG~B Am / " / " / " /

!So tell God...

The Gods don't verture down here, the Devil lost your name
Your life hangs in the balance on this fragile human chain
And when your spirrits whirling the fear is yours to tame
When you feel the darkness closing turn up your carbit flame

!And tell God...
!So tell God...
