[Intro]
# C F (4x)

Blue jean baby, L.A. lady, seamstress for the band
Pretty eyed, pirate smile, you'll marry a music man
Ballerina, you must have seen her dancing in the sand
And now she's in me, always with me, tiny dancer in my hand

Jesus freaks out in the street, handing tickets out for God
Turning back she just laughs, the boulevard is not that bad
Piano man he makes his stand in the auditorium
Looking on she sings the songs, the words she knows, the tune she hums

^But oh how it feels so real, lying here with no one near
^Only you and you can hear me
^When I say softly, slowly

(2x)
!Hold me closer, tiny dancer
!Count the headlights on the highway
!Lay me down in sheets of linen
!You had a busy day today
# F C~E Dm DmEm / F C~E G- ://

[Repeat all]
