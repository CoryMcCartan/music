Just a small-town girl, livin' in a lonely world
She took the midnight train goin' anywhere
# E B C#m A / E B G#m A

Just a city boy, born and raised in South Detroit
He took the midnight train goin' anywhere

A singer in a smokey room, the smell of wine and cheap perfume
For a smile they can share the night, it goes on and on, and on, and on

!Strangers waiting up and down the boulevard
!Their sh_adows searching in the night
!Streetlights, people, livin' just to find emotion
!Hidin' somewhere in the night
# A- E- / A- E- / A- E- / A- BE BEA

Workin' hard to get my fill, everybody wants a thrill
Payin' anything to roll the dice just one more time

Some will win, some will lose, some were born to sing the blues
Oh, the movie never ends, it goes on and on, and on, and on

![Chorus]

(3x)
Don't stop believin'
Hold on to that feelin'
Streetlight people
