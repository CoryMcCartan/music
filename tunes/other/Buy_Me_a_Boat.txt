I ain't rich, but I damn sure wanna b_e
Working like a dog all day ain't working for m_e
I wish I had a rich uncle that'd kick the bucket, and I was sitting on a pile like Warren Buffett
I know everybody says money c_an't buy happiness
# D- G- / D- A- / D- G- / D- A- 

!But it could buy me a b_o_at, it could buy me a tr_uck to pull it
!It could buy me a Yeti 110 iced down with some silver bullets
!Yeah, and I know what they say, money c_an't buy everything
!Well, maybe so, but it could buy me a boat
# " / " / " / " / D A D- 

They call me redneck, white trash and blue collar
But I could change all that if I had a couple million dollars
I keep hearing that money is the root of all evil and you can't fit a camel through the eye of a needle
I'm sure that's probably true, but it still sounds pretty cool

!'Cause it could buy me a boat...

^...To float down on the water with a b_eer
^I hear the Powerball Lotto is a-s_itting on a hundred mill
^Well, that would b_uy me a brand new rod and reel
# G- / A- / G A 

![Chorus]

!Yeah, and I know what they say, money can't buy everything
!Well, maybe so, but it could buy me a boat
!It could buy me a boat.
