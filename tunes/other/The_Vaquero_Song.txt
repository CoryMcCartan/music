[Intro/Interlude]

My name is Juan Medina, a vaquero once was I
Now I live in the air above the pepper trees
Where are all the cattle, that belonged to Captain Dana
They're blown away like ashes in the California breeze

And once I rode the foothills, and I swung a long reata
I worked the hide and tallow trade in the land I loved
I rode in wooden stirrups, and the dust raised by my ponies
Was smoke, from my alter offered up to the God above

!Todavía estoy aquí, I am still here
!Todavía estoy aquí, my soul is dancing in the moonlight
!I mingle with each grain of sand in the land that is my birthright
!I am still h_ere, todavía estoy aquí (2x)

In the canyon and barrancas, and willows by the creek bank
I chased the wild cattle through the live oak trees
Cross valleys ridge and mesa, and the hills baked oh so yellow
My ponies sleek and dancing were all a man would need

In the fog of early morning, o'er the misty haze of twilight
Beyond the sagging ruins of these adobe walls 
You may see me in the dust that shimmers in the half light
Or hear me in the whisper of the grass so green and tall

My name is Juan Medina, a vaquero once was I
Now I live, in the air above of the pepper trees.....
