Somet_imes in our l_ives
We all have p_ain, we all have s_orrow
But if we are wise,
We know that there's always tomorrow
# D-- EmF#m G--- F#mEm / 
# D-- EmF#m A --- / 1st / D--- A- D-

!Lean on me when you're not strong
!I'll be your friend, I'll help you carry on
!For it won't be long
!'Til I'm gonna need somebody to lean on

Please swallow your pride
If I have things you need to borrow
For no one can fill those of your needs
That you won't let show.

^You just call on me, brother, when you need a hand
^We all need somebody to lean on.
^I just might have a problem that you'll understand,
^We all need somebody to lean on.
# D--- ---- / ---- A- D- ://

![Chorus]
^[Bridge]

If there is a load
You have to bear, that you can't carry
I'm right up the road
I'll share your load if you just call me
