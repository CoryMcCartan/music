!In my mind, I'm gone to Carolina
!Can't you see the sunshine?
!Now can't you just feel the moonshine?
!And ain't it just like a friend of mine to hit me from behind?
!Yes, I'm gone to Carolina in my mind

Karen, she's a silver sun
You best walk her way and watch it shine
Watch her watch the morning come
A silver tear appearing now I'm crying, ain't I?
I'm gone to Carolina in my mind

There ain't no doubt in no one's mind
That love's the finest thing around
Whisper something soft and kind
And hey, babe, the sky's on fire, I'm dying, ain't I?
I'm gone to Carolina in my mind

[Chorus]

Dark and silent late last night
I think I might have heard the highway call
Geese in flight and dogs that bite
And signs that might be omens say I'm going, going
Gone to Carolina in my mind

[Bridge]
^Now with a holy host of others standing 'round me, no no
^Still I'm on the dark side of the moon
^And it looks like it goes on like this forever
^You must forgive me ... if I'm up and
Gone to Carolina in my mind
