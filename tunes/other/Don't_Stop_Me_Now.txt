Tonight I'm gonna have myself a real good time, I feel alive
And the w_orld, I'll turn it inside out, yeah, I'm floating around in ecstasy
So don't stop me now, don't stop me
'Cause I'm h_aving a good time, having a good time

I'm a shooting star leaping through the sky like a tiger 
Defying the l_aws of gravity
I'm a racing car passing by Like Lady Godiva
I'm gonna _g_o go go, there's no stopping me

!I'm b_urning through the sky, yeah, two hundred degrees
!That's why they c_all me Mister Fahrenheit
!I'm tr_aveling at the speed of light
!I wanna make a s_upersonic man out of you

!Don't stop me now, I'm having such a good time, I'm having a ball
!Don't stop me now, if you wanna have a good time, just give me a call
!Don't stop me, 'cause I'm having a good time

I'm a rocket ship on my way to Mars, on a collision course
I am a satellite
I'm out of control
I am a sex machine ready to reload
Like an atom bomb about to-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh explode

!I'm burning through the sky...
!I wanna make a supersonic woman of you

[Bridge and Solo]

!Ooh I'm burning through the sky...
!I wanna make a supersonic man out of you

!Don't stop me now...
