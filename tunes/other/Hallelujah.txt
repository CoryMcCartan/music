Now, I he_a_rd there was a se_cret chord
That Da_vid played and it ple_ased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do you?
Well it goes like this: The fourth, the fifth, 
The minor fall and the major lift
The baffled king composing Hallelujah
# C Am /  / F G C Am / C FG / Am F / G E Am-

!Hallelujah, Hallelujah, 
!Hallelujah, Hallelujah
# F- Am- / F- C G C-

Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you
She tied you to her kitchen chair
She broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

Well, baby, I've been here before
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor 
I used to live alone before I knew you
And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
And love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Well, there was a time when you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show that to me, do ya?
But remember when I moved in you
And the holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah
# C Am /  / F G C G / C FG / Am F / G E Am-

Maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew you
And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah
